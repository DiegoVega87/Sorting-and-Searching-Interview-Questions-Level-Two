    * As a data analyst at a fast-growing startup, you have been tasked with identifying the peak sales periods for
    * the company. You have been provided with an integer array 'sales_data' which represents the daily sales figures
    * for the past month. Your task is to write a function that can find a peak element in the 'sales_data' array.
    * A peak element is defined as an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors, thus a better result was
    * achieved for this day. Identify the indices of all peak elements in sales_data.
