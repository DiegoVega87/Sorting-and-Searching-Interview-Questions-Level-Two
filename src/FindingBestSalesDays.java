    /*
    * As a data analyst at a fast-growing startup, you have been tasked with identifying the peak sales periods for
    * the company. You have been provided with an integer array 'sales_data' which represents the daily sales figures
    * for the past month. Your task is to write a function that can find a peak element in the 'sales_data' array.
    * A peak element is defined as an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors, thus a better result was
    * achieved for this day. Identify the indices of all peak elements in sales_data.
    *
    * Example 1:
    *
    * int[] sales_data = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1};
    * List<Integer> expectedOutput = Arrays.asList(4);
    * List<Integer> actualOutput = findPeakElements(sales_data);
    * assert expectedOutput.equals(actualOutput);
    *
    * Example 2:
    * int[] sales_data = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9};
    * List<Integer> expectedOutput = Arrays.asList();
    * List<Integer> actualOutput = findPeakElements(sales_data);
    * assert expectedOutput.equals(actualOutput);
