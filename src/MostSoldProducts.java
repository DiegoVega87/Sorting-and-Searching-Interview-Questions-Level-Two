    * As a startup, we want to analyze our customers' purchase history to identify the top k frequently used products.
    * We need you to write a function that takes in an integer array of sold product IDs and an integer k, and returns
    * the k most frequent products.
    *
    * Example 1:
    * int[] products = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1};
    * int k = 2;
    * List<Integer> result = topKFrequent(products, k);
    * System.out.println(result);
    * Output:[1, 2
    *
    * Example 2:
    * int[] products = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1};
    * int k = 3;
    * List<Integer> result = topKFrequent(products, k);
    * System.out.println(result);
    * Output:[1, 2, 3]
