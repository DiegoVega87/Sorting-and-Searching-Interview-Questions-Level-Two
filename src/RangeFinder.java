    * Your startup has a database of customer purchase histories. You need to create a function that takes an array
    * of integers representing the purchase amounts sorted in non-decreasing order and an integer representing the exact
    * amount sold. The function should return an array of two integers representing the starting and ending positions
    * of the target purchase amount.
    *
    * Example 1:
    * int[] purchases = {10, 20, 35, 40, 50};
    * int targetAmount = 30;
    * int[] expectedOutput = {0, 1};
    *
    * Example 2:
    * int[] purchases = {5, 10, 15, 22, 25, 30, 35};
    * int targetAmount = 25;
    * int[] expectedOutput = {1, 2};
